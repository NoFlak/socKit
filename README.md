## Overview

socKit aims to deliver a modular, open-source SOC toolkit supporting:

- **Blue Team:** Audit Active Directory, monitor event logs, detect malware persistence, check patch compliance, and validate content authenticity.  
- **Red Team:** Tools for penetration testing, privilege escalation, reconnaissance, and exploitation.  
- **Purple Team:** Integration tools and workflows to improve collaboration between Red and Blue teams.  
- **Core Utilities:** Logging, SIEM integration, system info collection, and centralized tool orchestration.

Dev note: July 23 2025
It is built for portability and can be run on Windows, Linux, and macOS environments with minimal dependencies.
It is also a side project while I am studying cyber security engineering to familiarize myself with tools used in the industry and simplify their usability for myself.
I had an older version with some tools built out already but lost some of it after a failed git merge attempt... mostly summed up as user error and no recent backup putting us where we are now.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/NoFlak/socKit.git
cd socKit

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the main interface or call specific modules:

python main_menu.py,
or for example, 
call python malware_scanner.py from terminal directly it might not get logging you want from direct call of specific tools until I add the enhanced logging in better.

# Malware Persistence & Execution Tracker (MPET) #
-------------------------------------------------

A Python tool to assist Blue Teams during Windows endpoint audits by detecting
persistence mechanisms used by malware or attackers.

## Features
- Scans common registry autostart locations (`Run`, `RunOnce`, services)
- Inspects startup folder executables (user and all users)
- Enumerates suspicious scheduled tasks
- Analyzes Windows Prefetch files for suspicious executions
- Parses PowerShell Operational Event Log for suspicious script executions
- Outputs detailed logs to console and log file (timestamped or custom path)
- Requires Administrator privileges to run

## Requirements
- Python 3.x (tested with 3.11)
- Windows OS (requires Windows APIs for admin check and system paths)
- No external dependencies

## Usage

Run interactively from command line:

```bash
python mpet_scan.py [--log path_to_logfile.txt]
